# Grid and Flexbox, living in harmony!

In this project, I utilized the combination of Grid and Flexbox in CSS to create a flexible and responsive layout. The goal is to combine the principles of CSS Grid and Flexbox to design an appealing webpage. All changes are made in CSS onlyâ€”HTML should not be edited.

### Tasks

1. **Convert the container to a grid**: The `.container` element is turned into a grid layout.
2. **Create four columns**: The grid should have four evenly spaced columns.
3. **Add spacing between items**: A 0.5em gap is added between the grid items.
4. **Create a flexbox for the grid items**: All grid items are turned into flexbox elements with a vertical layout.
5. **Center content**: The content inside the flexboxes is centered both vertically and horizontally.
6. **Text and background styling**: The text color of the grid items is set to `#eee`, and the background is made semi-transparent.
7. **Add hover effect**: A box-shadow hover effect is added to the grid items, making them appear interactive.
8. **Additional styling**: Further styling is applied to match the example screenshot.
